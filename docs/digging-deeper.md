# Digging Deeper

The steps provided in [the installation instructions](installation.md) are very basic.  Your application likely will require more.

You can get more familiar with Elide by reading the following documentation:

- [Partials](./digging-deeper/partials.md)
- [`Htmx::render()`](./digging-deeper/htmx-render.md)
- [`HtmxRequest`](./digging-deeper/htmx-request.md)
- [`HtmxResponse`](./digging-deeper/htmx-response.md)


Check out [guides and recipes](guides-recipes.md) for examples of how you can use Elide and HTMX to create a dynamic frontend.
