# Intro

Elide is a small package for use with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). It aims to  
streamline the gap between backend and frontend by making it easier to return full page responses, or just necessary partials (i.e., components).  
  
Strongly inspired by [Inertia](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-laravel).
