## Intro

Elide is a small package for use with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). It aims to
streamline the gap between backend and frontend by making it easier to return full page responses, or just necessary
partials (i.e., components).

Strongly inspired by [Inertia](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-laravel).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Elide is in early development. Perhaps best not to use in production just yet.
