## Introduction

Elide is a small package for use with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). It aims to streamline the gap between backend and frontend by making it easier to return full page responses, or just necessary partials (i.e., components). It also provides handy methods of checking HTMX properties of requests and responses.

Strongly inspired by [Inertia](https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia-laravel).

Elide is open-source software licensed under the MIT licence.

## Documentation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Elide leverages HTMX's swap attributes - you should have an understanding of how HTMX works before using Elide.
> [HTMX's documentation](https://htmx.org/docs/) covers pretty much everything, and the [HTMX examples](https://htmx.org/examples/) provide a lot of practical examples of how to use HTMX in the frontend to talk to the backend.
